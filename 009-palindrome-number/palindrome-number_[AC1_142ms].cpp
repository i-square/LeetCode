// Some hints:
//
// Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
//
// If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
//
// You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
//
// There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
